          <h2>My <span class="state">Past</span> Experience</h2>
          <p>After high school, I attended Indiana University (Go Hoosiers!) and graduated with a Bachelor's in Geological Sciences and a Minor in Physics.</p>
          <p>Passionate as I was about rocks, I couldn't see myself going to work for the Oil and Gas Industry. After all, I originally majored in Environmental Science so taking care of our Earth is still very much important to me!</p>
          <p>I took the advice of a geologist I consulted about entering the workforce, and looked into Geographic Information Systems (GIS)</p>
          <p>Before long I accepted an entry level position at a small GIS firm in San Diego.</p>

        <article class="card" id="present">
          <h2>My <span class="state">Present</span> Career</h2>        
          <p>It has now been three years since I accepted that entry level position as a Field Technician, and I am very proud to have worked my way up to a management position.</p>
          <p>From rural foothills and farmland to major US cities, I have experience managing data collection and asset management projects both large and small for a wide variety of customers.</p>
          <p>I pride myself on my excellent communication skills, and often use these skills in order to effectively bridge communication between various project stakeholders and for training new field technicians to be successful.</p>

        <article class="card" id="future">
          <h2>The <span class="state">Future</span> I'm Preparing For</h2>        
          <p>Creating a new career path is not an easy task, especially when the path you've already started demands 40+ hours of your week.</p>
          <p>That's why <strong><em>passion</em></strong> is so essential.</p>
          <p>Passion is what keeps me waking up early to spend a few hours coding before starting each day of work - It's what drives me to spend a few hours of my evenings coding at a local coffee shop.</p>
          <p>With enough <em>passion</em> and <em>persistence</em>, I'm hoping to create the future I desire in web development!</p>
