          <h2>Portland, <span class="state">Oregon</span></h2>
          <p>After eating way too much Portillo's and Lou Malnati's over the 2018 Holiday Season, I began 2019 back in Portland, OR</p>
          <p>Along with enjoying plenty of delicious food and beer, I finished managing a project for Oregon DOT that had started the previous fall.</p>
          <p>Portland reminds me of Chicago a lot. That's probably why I really fell in love with this city during my time living here.</p>
          <p>Soon after, I headed to the East Coast...</p>

          <h2>Miami Beach, <span class="state">Florida</span></h2>        
          <p>As I moved to yet another project in yet another state, I traded cozy flannels and seemingly infinite cannabis dispensaries for exotic cars, art districts, and coffee that fell far below my newly set standards.</p>
          <p>A good friend of mine from back home was attending medical school nearby, and she would soon become a reliable beer buddy.</p>

          <h2>Columbus, <span class="state">Mississippi</span></h2>        
          <p>If there is one thing I can compliment the South on, it's food. It's incredibly heavy, and you will be too if you eat it consistently, but it was all worth it.</p>
          <p>The crawfish.. the barbecue.. the fried green tomatoes..</p>
          <p>Let's just say I now have a gym membership and workout regularly. Something I certainly should've implemented into my routine earlier, but that southern comfort food helped catalyze.</p>

            <h2>Fresno, <span class="state">California</span></h2>
            <p>Currently I am back on the West Coast. I'm working in the Fresno area and it's regularly over 100&#176;F...<br> I very much resent it for this reason.</p>
            <p>For the past month I've been using my free time to focus more on web development and less on video games. It's really quite remarkable how much I've progressed after buckling down and sticking with it.</p>
            <p>That being said, reach out if you'd like to play some Counter Strike sometime ;)</p>
